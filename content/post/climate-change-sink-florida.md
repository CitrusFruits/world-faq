First of all, let’s establish that climate change is real, and currently happening.

“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.” - International Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report 2014[1].

Global CO2 levels have increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution (circa 1850) and 97% of climate scientists agree the the overall climate warming trends are very likely due to human activities[2]. The world’s climate is warming, and humans are responsible.

Florida isn’t sinking, but sea levels are rising. The global average sea level has risen 6.7 inches in the last century, and the rate of sea level rise in the past decade is twice that of what it has been for the past 100 years. Florida is typically used as a poster child for the dangers sea level rise due to its combined large mass of low altitude lands, large amounts of coastline, and highly populated coastal cities. While some of these cities, such as Miami, are currently struggling to fight the already present effects of sea level rise[3], a rise in sea level is not about to submerge Florida any time soon. A 3 foot rise in sea level would leave the vast majority of Florida above water, submerging only the southern tip and portions of the coast[4]. This amount of sea level rise would be greater than the International Panel on Climate Change maximum estimate of a 2.69 foot increase in sea level over the next 100 years[5]. While these estimates don’t anticipate the majority of Florida to be completely submerged, this isn’t to say that sea level rise is not a concern. Sea level rises will directly negatively affect every non landlocked nation, in many cases quite severely.

In a 2014 research report by Climate Central it was estimated that anywhere between 147 and 216 million people, roughly 2.0-2.9% the global population, currently live on land that will be below sea level or regular flood levels by the end of the century. The most at risk countries, by percentage of population that will be below sea level or chronic flood levels, are Netherlands (47%), Vietnam (26%), Thailand (12%), Japan (10%), and Myanmar (9%). By population the most at risk countries are China (50.4 million), Vietnam (23.4 million), Japan (12.7 million), India (12.6 million), and Bangladesh (10.2 million)[6].

Sea levels are rising due to warming trends in global climate change which is ultimately caused by increased carbon emissions amongst other human activities.
