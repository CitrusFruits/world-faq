A corporation can be defined as an artificial individual used to represent the actions, responsibilities, and assets of a business or institution [1]. There are a couple key things to understand about corporations:

A corporations is, for many intents and purposes, a legal person with limited rights[1]. Corporations have “birth” and “death” certificates, can perform actions, have the right to defend themselves in court, can own assets, etc.
A large motivation in forming a corporation (or LLC for that matter) is to protect its owners by moving individual liability (legal responsibility) from owners and employees to the corporation itself[1]. If someone gets injured because Corporation A made an unsafe car, they cannot sue Corporation A’s engineers, managers, marketing department, or even CEO. They have to make a legal case against Corporation A [2].
Corporations are responsible to a wide variety of individuals who have some sort of interest in the performance of the corporation. These parties are known as stakeholders and can include shareholders, employees, customers as well as parties that have indirect relationships with the corporation such as local or global communities or governments [3].

Corporations are, by nature, complex entities. When considering the structure for a business, some variation of a corporation typically becomes the obvious choice due to the limited liability, high liquidity, and more robust life cycle, especially in light of some of the serious drawbacks of other alternatives (sole proprietorship or partnership) [1]. In other words, when growing a business of any reasonable size, it is foolish not to establish a corporation or LLC. While this accounts for the pervasiveness of a modern corporation, it doesn’t account for often confusing, amoral, or sometimes egregious actions that corporations take. 

This is typically accounted for and framed as conflict of stakeholder interest. From each stakeholder’s point of view whether it be shareholders, employees, or the community that surrounds a business, they have an ideal outcome for the actions of the respective corporation. However, it is up to the corporation’s management to decide to which parties they are most responsible[3]. Typically in the past and for the most part in the present, publicly traded companies will choose to primarily serve their shareholders first by maximizing return on investment through increased profits. In the United States, it is commonly accepted that the board of directors have legal obligations to serve the interests of their shareholders [5].

An important thing to recognize in light of this pervasive “serve the shareholder only” mentality is that there is movement in the industry against it. This sort of movement is typically attributed to the term Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), where other non-monetarily invested stakeholders such as surrounding communities, the environment, and even other companies/people involved in supply chains are being taken into greater consideration and in some cases being recognized as a core responsibility [4]. Certainly not all corporations are on board with this philosophy, but it is worth noting.
