Crude oil, a fossil fuel that is a product of heating and compression of organic materials over millions of years[1], is typically refined into petroleum. While petroleum can be used to create a variety of goods including plastics, polyurethane, and solvents, it is most popularly used to create fuel. The most popular types of petroleum based fuels are, in order of total U.S. consumption, gasoline, distillate fuel oils (diesel, heating oil), hydrocarbon gas liquids (propane, ethane, butane, etc.), and jet fuels [2].

There are a variety of estimates offering differing amounts of years before the Earth will run out of oil. British Petroleum’s (BP) most recent estimate in 2014 claimed that, at the time, we had 53.3 years of oil left [3]. In the same year the International Business Times and Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IME) claimed we only had 40 years in major oil fields at current consumption rates [4]. However, there are others who assert that these predictions are misleading, since they only account for proven reserves. A proven reserve is an oil reserve in which there is at least a 90% certainty that the oil within the reserve can be extracted in a economically profitable manner, with existing technologies[5]. Proven reserves don’t fully encompass the actual amount of oil left on the Earth, which is significantly greater than what the predictions by BP or the IME lead the reader to believe[6]. The individuals that err on the more abundant view of Earth’s oil reserves tend to not give definitive predictions on the remaining amount of years left, and usually do not go into detail on the challenges of retrieving oil from unproven reserves.

The time at which oil is no longer economically available to retrieve on a mass scale is approaching, but as the U.S. Energy Information Association aptly puts it, “there is substantial uncertainty about the levels of future liquid fuels supply and demand” [7].
