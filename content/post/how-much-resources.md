How much raw materials (iron/gold/silver) do we have on earth? What is the most sustainable material? 

When asking how much materials we have on earth, it is more than likely that you’re thinking of oil first. If you're interested in that, please check out the article [here]({{< ref "post/how-much-oil.md" >}}).

Other Resources
Oil is not the only non-renewable resource that humanity currently depends on. It’s difficult to develop an objective metric for the most important natural earthly resources, but the folks at Conserve Energy Future have come up with a top 10 list that covers all of the big ones. Those resources are water, air, coal, oil, natural gas, phosphorus, other minerals, iron, soil, and forests/timber. Water and air are basic necessities for human life. Coal, oil, and natural gas are all sources of fuel, used for transportation or converted into electricity. Phosphorus is a natural fertilizer. Other minerals include things like gypsum, bauxite, phosphate, bentonite, mica, titanium, zirconium, scandium, and terbium. Soil is used to grow crops. Forests/timber keep our air full of oxygen and are used as a building material [1]. 

In 2012, BBC did a “Global Resource Stock Check” where they compiled a graph that visualized the lifetime of many of our most important resources. According to that article, coral reefs, agricultural land, coal, oil, gas, aluminum, tantalum, titanium, copper, silver, indium, and antimony will all be used up within the next 100 years [2]. The numbers for their chart are only best guesses, but the results still enforce the statement that in a world with a population as large as ours, these resources are scarce.
