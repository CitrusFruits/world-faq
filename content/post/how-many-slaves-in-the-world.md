To understand the prevalence of slavery in the world today, first we have to come to a understanding of what is considered slavery.

Classically slavery can be defined as the state of a person who is owned by another person [1]. This form of slavery has been outlawed in every country in the world, although that does not necessarily mean it is enforced. Most data gathering organizations today, however, choose to use a broader and more inclusive term. We are going to use The Global Slavery Index’s definition of slavery term “modern slavery”[2] along with their definition for it. For them “modern slavery” includes:

- Forced labor
- Debt bondage
- Forced marriage
- Slavery
- Slavery-like practices


According to their 2018 report, there are an estimated 40.3 million people across 167 countries in some form of slavery. The highest by proportion are North Korea (10.46%), Eritrea (9.30%), Burundi (4.00%), Central African Republic (2.23%), and Afghanistan (2.22%) with the lowest by proportion being Lowest by proportion: Japan (0.029%) Canada (0.048%), Taiwan (0.049%), New Zealand (0.064%), and Australia (0.065%). The highest resident populations in modern slavery on a per country basis reside in India (7,989,000), China (3,864,400),  Pakistan (3,186,000), North Korea (2,640,000), and Nigeria (1,386,000). United states has an estimated 403,000 persons in modern slavery which is 0.13% of the population. [3]

Slaves cost 95% less today than they did at the height of the 19th century slave trade. [4]

There’s another answer to this question, and it’s that there is at least one slave in the world today. All of the statistics above are estimates and it’s really easy to get lost in or overwhelmed by the numbers. While understanding the landscape of a tragedy is certainly important, I think it’s all too often distracting from the heart of the issue:

Someone, somewhere out there, owns another person.
