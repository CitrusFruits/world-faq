The answer to this question, quite unsatisfactorily, is that it depends. Chances that the clothes you are wearing were made in a manufacturing facility by anyone who would be considered a slave, by the common definition of modern slavery, are less than likely but still substantial. That is not to say that all employees at the factory(ies) that your clothes were made in were well taken care of. For example, in China, the World’s largest exporter of textiles, the best case scenario for a worker, with respect to minimum wage, is 18.7 RMB (~2.84 USD)/hour in Beijing, with the worst case being 11 RMB (~1.67 USD) in various other regions of China[1]. However, from an American point of view, these numbers do not accurately reflect the worker’s buying power in their resident regions, which even still does not in actuality accurately reflect the worker’s quality of life (QoL).

Judging the quality of a human individual’s life is no easy task. The best publicly available insights into factory workers’ lives are articles and reports found on the Internet detailing Asian factory working and living conditions. These articles and reports, although sometimes incredibly insightful, are sparse and often not up to date. In addition to this, articles and reports such as these often focus on a single country, which can be unhelpful in finding the QoL of the factory workers who made your garments, if they were not made in said country.

As an average American consumer, it is often an overly onerous, not to mention ambitious, task to attempt to judge the QoL of any given factory worker making your clothes. Yes, the conditions of workers who make garments in factories of developing nations is a huge ethical concern, but it is not necessarily something that the consumer is typically well equipped to address. This is largely because most consumer goods corporations have big issues with supply chain transparency and defending human rights for their contracted manufacturing facilities[2]. While there are notable exceptions, typically clothing companies don’t make transparency and basic human rights within their supply chain a top priority. Although Gap certainly isn’t the only offender, they make an excellent case study with what they [say](http://www.gapincsustainability.com/people/improving-factory-working-conditions) versus what [has happened](http://www.waronwant.org/media/experts-rank-gap-worlds-worst-company-failing-bangladesh-workers-safety). In contrast, however, Patagonia, once again not the only company working in earnest towards ethical manufacturing, actually [follows through](http://www.outsideonline.com/1999281/slaving-over-our-gear) on what they say [they're all about](http://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=67372).

Clothes these days can be purchased from any number of companies, each of which could have a manufacturing supply chain reaching any number of places throughout the world. Working conditions vary from factory to factory and country to country, and it’s usually not easy for a consumer to track them all down. There are clothing companies who diligently work to ensure humane working conditions throughout the supply chain, and there are those that do not make ethical treatment of the humans directly responsible for producing their clothes a legitimate priority.
